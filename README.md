# Advanced Video Transcriber with Speaker Diarization

A state-of-the-art Python tool that converts MP4 videos into highly accurate Excel transcriptions with speaker identification and precise timestamps. This system combines advanced speech recognition (OpenAI Whisper) with speaker diarization (pyannote.audio) and intelligent noise reduction (DeepFilterNet).

## 🚀 Features

- **High-Accuracy Transcription**: Uses OpenAI Whisper large-v3 model for best-in-class speech recognition
- **Speaker Diarization**: Automatically identifies and labels different speakers (Speaker 1, Speaker 2, etc.)
- **Precise Timestamps**: Word-level timestamp accuracy in HH:MM:SS format
- **Noise Reduction**: Built-in DeepFilterNet denoising for cleaner audio processing
- **Excel Output**: Professional Excel files with proper formatting and column sizing
- **Multi-Language Support**: Automatic language detection and transcription
- **GPU Acceleration**: CUDA support for faster processing when available

## 📋 Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU (optional, but recommended for faster processing)
- Sufficient RAM (8GB+ recommended for large videos)
- Internet connection (for initial model downloads)

## 🛠️ Installation

### Quick Setup (Windows)
```bash
# Run the setup script
setup.bat
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Install PyTorch (with CUDA if available)
pip install torch torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install additional audio processing libraries
pip install pyannote.audio[audio]
```

### Hugging Face Setup (Required for Speaker Diarization)
1. Create a free account at https://huggingface.co/
2. Go to https://huggingface.co/pyannote/speaker-diarization-3.1 and accept the terms
3. Login via command line:
```bash
huggingface-cli login
```

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python video_transcriber.py input_video.mp4 output_transcript.xlsx
```

### Advanced Options
```bash
# Use different Whisper model size
python video_transcriber.py lecture.mp4 transcript.xlsx --model large-v3

# Skip noise reduction for clean audio
python video_transcriber.py meeting.mp4 result.xlsx --no-denoise

# Force CPU usage
python video_transcriber.py video.mp4 output.xlsx --device cpu

# Show help
python video_transcriber.py --help
```

### Legacy Audio Denoising Only
```bash
python denoiser.py input_video.mp4 output_video.mp4
```

## 📊 Output Format

The Excel file contains exactly three columns:

| Timestamp | Speaker | Transcript |
|-----------|---------|------------|
| 00:00:01 | Speaker 1 | Hello, welcome to our meeting. |
| 00:00:04 | Speaker 2 | Thank you for having me. |
| 00:00:07 | Speaker 1 | Let's start with the agenda. |

## 🔧 Model Options

### Whisper Models (accuracy vs speed trade-off)
- `tiny`: Fastest, least accurate
- `base`: Good balance for quick transcription  
- `small`: Better accuracy, still fast
- `medium`: High accuracy, moderate speed
- `large`: Very high accuracy, slower
- `large-v3`: **Best accuracy** (default, recommended)

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

1. **Use GPU**: CUDA acceleration significantly speeds up processing
2. **Clean Audio**: Let the noise reduction run for better transcriptions
3. **Good Quality Video**: Higher quality audio = better results
4. **Sufficient RAM**: Large videos may require 8GB+ RAM
5. **Stable Internet**: First run downloads ~3GB of models

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**CUDA Out of Memory**
```bash
# Use CPU instead
python video_transcriber.py video.mp4 output.xlsx --device cpu
```

**Pyannote Authentication Error**
```bash
# Make sure you've accepted the model terms and logged in
huggingface-cli login
```

**Long Processing Time**
- Use smaller Whisper model: `--model medium`
- Ensure GPU is being used (check console output)
- Process shorter video segments

### Performance Benchmarks

| Video Length | GPU (RTX 3080) | CPU (Intel i7) |
|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 5 minutes   | ~2 minutes     | ~8 minutes      |
| 30 minutes  | ~8 minutes     | ~35 minutes     |
| 2 hours     | ~25 minutes    | ~2 hours        |
